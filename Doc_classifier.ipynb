It is less than 45°C outside today. \\nTherefore, the pollution is dangerous.  \\nc) Vijay is an excellent swimmer. If Vijay is an \\nexcellent swimmer, then he can work as a lifeguard. \\nTherefore,  Vijay can work as a lifeguard.  \\nd) Shiva will work at a grocery store  this summer. \\nTherefore, this summer Shiva will work at a grocery \\nstore  or he will spend his time at the Goa Beach . \\ne) If I work all night on this homework, then I can \\nanswer all the exercises. If I answer all the exercises, I \\nwill understand the content of the course CO -205. \\nTherefore, if I work all night on this homework, then I \\nwill understand the content of the course CO -205. \\n \\n2. For each of these sets of premises, what relevant \\nconclusion or conclusions can be drawn? State the rules of \\ninference used to obtain each conclusion from the \\npremises.  \\na) “If I play hockey, then I am sore the next day.” “I \\nuse the whirlpool if I am sore.” “I did not use the \\nwhirlpool.”  \\nb) “If I work, it is either sunny or partly sunny.” “I \\nworked last Monday or I worked last Friday.” “It was \\nnot sunny on Tuesday.” “It was not partly sunny on \\nFriday.”  \\nc) “All insects have six legs.” “Dragonflies are insects.” \\n“Spiders do not have six legs.” “Spiders eat \\ndragonflies.”  \\nd) “Every student has an Internet account.” “Henry \\ndoes not have an Internet account.” “M amta  has an \\nInternet account.”  \\ne) “All foods that are healthy to eat do not taste good.” \\n“Bitter -gourd is healthy to eat.” “You only eat what \\ntastes good.” “You do not eat bitter -gourd.” \\n“Cheeseburgers are not healthy to eat.”  \\nf ) “I am either dreaming or hallucinating.” “I am not \\ndreaming.” “If I am hallucinating, I see elephants \\nrunning  down the road.”   \\n \\n3. Show that the argument form with premises (p ∧ t) → \\n(r ∨ s), q → (u ∧ t), u → p, q and ~s and conclusion  r is \\nvalid.   \\n \\n3.1.

Confirm  the validity of each of these arguments (state \\nthe rules of inference are used for each step ). \\na) “Linda, a student in this class, owns a red car. \\nEveryone who owns a red car has got at  least one \\nspeeding ticket. Therefore, someone in this class has \\ngot a speeding ticket.”  b) “There is someone in this class who has been to \\nFrance. Everyone who goes to France visits the  Louvre. \\nTherefore, someone in this class has visited the \\nLouvre.”  \\n \\n5. Determine whether each of these arguments is valid. If \\nan argument is correct, what rule of inference is being \\nused? If it is not, what logical error occurs?  \\na) If n is a real number such that n > 1, then n2 > 1. \\nSuppose that n2 > 1; then,  n > 1. \\nb) If n is a real number with n > 3, then n2 > 9.

Use resolution to show the hypotheses “Allen is a bad \\nboy or Hillary is a good girl” and “Allen is a good boy or \\nDavid is happy” imply the conclusion “Hillary is a good \\ngirl or David is happy.”  \\n \\n6.1. Based on the following premises about the trip of four \\nfriends to a hill station: - \\nPremise A:  Amit paid for the trip and Bobby paid for the \\nhotel reservations or Charlie paid for everything.  \\nPremise B:  If Charlie paid for everything, then David is \\ngoing on the trip.  \\nCan it be concluded that – “Amit paid for the trip or David \\nis going on the trip”? Justify your answer.  \\n \\n6.2.  Is the following argument valid? Justify your answer.  \\nPremise A: “If the birthday gift is a box of chocolates, then \\nthe child will be happy”.  \\nPremise B: “The child is happy”  \\nTherefore, it can be concluded that “the birthday gift is a \\nbox of chocolates”.  \\n \\n6.3. Test the validity of the following argument:  \\n(a) Babies are illogical  \\n(b) Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile  \\n(c) Illogical persons are despised  \\nTherefore babies cannot manage crocodiles  \\n \\n6.4 Test the validity of the following argument: - \\n(a) It is not sunny today and it is colder than \\nyesterday.  \\n(b) We will go for swimming only if it is sunny.  \\n(c) If we don’t go for swimming, we will go for a \\ntrekking trip.  \\n(d) If we go out trekking, then we will come home \\nby sunset.  \\nTherefore, it can be concluded that we will be home \\nby sunset.  \\n \\nDirect / Indirect  Proofs  \\n7.

Prove that if 𝑚 and 𝑛 are integers and 𝑚𝑛 is even, then \\n𝑚 is even or 𝑛 is even.  \\n \\n11. Show that if 𝑛 is an integer and 𝑛3 + 5 is odd, then n \\nis even using  \\na) a proof by contraposition.  \\nb) a proof by contradiction.  \\n \\n12. Prove the proposition P(0), where P(n) is the \\nproposition “If n is a positive integer greater than 1, then \\nn2 > n.” What kind of proof did you use?  \\n \\n13. Show that if you pick three socks from a drawer \\ncontaining just blue socks and black socks, you must get \\neither  a pair of blue socks or a pair of black socks.  \\n \\n14.
